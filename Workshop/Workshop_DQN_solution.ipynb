    "Deep Reinforcement learning has resulted in superman performance in a range of scenarios, such as Chess, Atari 2600, and Starcraft, but also in robotics. The main reason for this success compared to traditional Reinforcement Learning is the introduction of deep neural networks. The first successful implementation of deep neural networks in combination with a Reinforcement learning algorithm was Mnih et. al. which was able to reach superhuman performan
